# SenseS project - Key facts 

## Current known issue (as at written Monday 20 June 2016)

### Playback of recorded sensor data is not happening in real time
* i.e. a 20 second recording will take up to two minutes to play back
* The big problem here is that we need this to work properly so that video playback and sensor data playback are synchronised.
